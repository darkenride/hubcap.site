 	<h1>the hubcap community</h1>
 	<p>the hubcap collective was established in 2019 by 2 college kids when they found 2 hubcaps on the side of the road. They took them to their tiny college apartment and each painted one. Many years, and many apartments later, the collection contains over 200 painted hubcaps housed by artists and hobbyists across the Chicagoland area.
